Approach for Question 1 - Which products should we order more of or less of?

To address this question, we focused on inventory reports to identify products in high demand and those with excellent performance. The objective was to optimize the supply and enhance the overall user experience by ensuring that best-selling products do not go out of stock.

We calculated the "low stock" by dividing the quantity of each product ordered by the quantity of the product in stock. By considering the ten highest rates, we identified the top ten products that were almost out-of-stock or completely out-of-stock.

Conclusion:

After conducting the analysis and comparing the "low stock" with the highest-performing products, it was evident that the "vintage cars" and "motorcycle" categories should be restocked frequently. These categories appeared six times within the top ten highest-performing products. By prioritizing the restocking of these product lines, the car store can meet customer demand more effectively and avoid running out of popular items.

The data-driven approach to inventory management allows the store to make informed decisions on ordering quantities, ensuring that customers have access to their preferred products while maintaining optimal inventory levels. This optimization will lead to higher customer satisfaction and increased revenue for the car store.

Approach for Question 2 - How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?

To address this question, we focused on categorizing customers based on their level of engagement and profitability. Our objective was to identify VIP (very important person) customers, who contribute significantly to the store's profits, and less-engaged customers, who bring in lower revenue.

We computed the total profit earned from each customer, which allowed us to distinguish between VIP customers and less-engaged customers. With this information, we can tailor marketing and communication strategies to cater to the specific needs of each customer segment.

Conclusion:

After analyzing the results and understanding the profit generated by both the top-performing and lowest-performing customers, we recommend the following strategies:

VIP Customers: Offer loyalty rewards and personalized services to the top-performing customers. This will help in strengthening their loyalty to the store, encouraging repeat purchases, and further increasing their contribution to the store's profits.

Less-Engaged Customers: Conduct surveys and engage in personalized communication to understand the needs and expectations of the less-engaged customers. Based on their feedback, strategize approaches to attract and retain these customers. Tailored marketing campaigns, discounts, or special offers can be employed to entice them and increase their engagement with the store.

By aligning marketing and communication strategies with customer behaviors, the car store can enhance customer satisfaction, increase customer retention, and ultimately boost overall profitability. The data-driven approach will enable the store to build strong customer relationships and maximize its revenue potential.

Approach for Question 3 - How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

In order to determine the budget for acquiring new customers, we calculated the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). The Customer Lifetime Value represents the average revenue generated by a customer during their entire relationship with the company.

To calculate the LTV, we analyzed historical data to determine the average revenue generated by each customer over their lifetime. By knowing the LTV, we can estimate how much profit a new customer will generate for the company.

Conclusion:

The analysis revealed that the average Customer Lifetime Value is £39,040. This means that, on average, each new customer will generate a profit of £39,040 over their relationship with the company.

With this crucial information, the company can make informed decisions about their marketing budget for acquiring new customers. They can allocate funds strategically to maximize the return on investment and ensure that the cost of acquiring new customers remains well below their lifetime value.

By using the Customer Lifetime Value as a guiding metric, the company can implement effective marketing campaigns that attract high-value customers, leading to sustainable growth and increased profitability.
